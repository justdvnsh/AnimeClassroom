<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The project aims to solve a personal problem of watching anime. This app helps you watch and download anime without any ads. Plus it also lets you read and save mangas into the app itself. It parses the animes online from the web in real-time to provide you with a seamless watching experience. 

Why an anime app ? Here's why:
* Netflix contains anime's, but there is no denying that the list of anime's are very limited in Netflix.
* You can watch anime online, but you have to suffer with the ads.
* You can easily download the animes and also read manga in your phone itself. 

__WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN HEAVY DEVELOPMENT, THEREFORE YOU MAY ENCOUNTER BUGS. You can OPEN the ISSUE on GITHUB REPOSITORY.__

__NEW ISSUES WILL BE ADDED REGULARLY__ 
  
__Do not PUT ANIMECLASSROOM OR ANY FORK OF IT INTO GOOGLE PLAYSTORE or Any other Store. It may VIOLATE THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS or you may encounter legal obligations.__
